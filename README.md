- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lawrenceaph, a dad and a lawyer, with a goal of becoming a competent coder.   
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m also interested in 3d modeling, rendering, compositing, photography, illustration, and videography, among others. Anything to do with creative expression. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning by doing and creating different things, mostly web sites, web apps, 3d art, and the occasional video.
