- 👋 Hi, I’m @lawrenceaph, a dad and a lawyer, with a goal of becoming a competent coder.   
- 👀 I’m also interested in 3d modeling, rendering, compositing, photography, illustration, and videography, among others. Anything to do with creative expression. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning by doing and creating different things, mostly web sites, web apps, 3d art, and the occasional video.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on meaningful projects at some point, but my focus right now is on building good foundations that might someday make me a good collaborator or a reliable teammate.
